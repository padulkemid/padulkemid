Hi! 🤟🏼My name is Fadhil, but you can call me Padul! 🤤

- 😈 This is my repo, all of my creations and stuffs made by me will be always
uploaded here ( I mean my codes! 🤖  ). 
- 😼 I like to explore new things, if you like it too, you could leave a
    ⭐️! ( or 🍴 )
- 🤯 Feel free to contact me anytime, visit my
    [***blog***](https://padulkem.id). I wrote stories there, please give me any
    reaction or comments! That should do it. 👍🏼
- 🚀 Most of the time I code *Javascript* for personal things and at my work, I mostly code in *Typescript*. I did tinker with *Go* and I wish I learn more about it! 🔗
