Hi! 🤟🏼My name is Fadhil, but you can call me Padul! 🤤

uploaded here ( I mean my codes! 🤖 ). 
- 😼 I like to explore new things, if you like it too, you could leave a
    ⭐️! ( or 🍴 )
- 🐲 Used [***nvim***](https://neovim.io) for everything. The best editor I've ever learned and
    use. *The One for All*, you can't resist. Once you good at this, you'll say
    goodbye for anything ( *even vscode* 😝 ).

    [***blog***](https://padulkem.id). I wrote stories there, please give me any
    reaction or comments! That should do it. 👍🏼
